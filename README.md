# Trant

This is my personal blog. 

Trant is a[portmanteau](https://www.britannica.com/topic/portmanteau-word) coined from two words Tech and Rant. Trant is a public documentation of a developer journey in tech - career, fails, wins, community, public learnings and giving back to the ecosystem.

The API of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/blossom-babs/trant-server)
